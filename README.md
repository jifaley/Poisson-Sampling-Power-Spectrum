# Poisson-Sampling-Power-Spectrum

A simple demo for showing the power spectrum of Poisson sampling vs. Random sampling

一个输出泊松采样能量谱的小demo, 与随机采样进行对比

The calculation of power spectrum is in PowerSpectrum.py. The value of DC is removed.

Note that you may need to calculate an average power spectrum of Poisson Sampling of k (e.g., 10) tries.

For further information of calculating power spectrum, see https://www.zhihu.com/question/22611929/answer/621009581

The Poisson Sampling is done by the Bridson method, see https://zodiac911.github.io/blog/blue-noise.html
